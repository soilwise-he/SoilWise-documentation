# Containerization

The general assumption of operating and developing the SWR is that we work with a containerised environment. This means that each software component, be it a database or other storage, or a service of soem kind, is compiled into a container image. These images are made available in a hub or repository, so that they can be deployed automatically whenever needed, including to fresh hardware.
