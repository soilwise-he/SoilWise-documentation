# Metadata Augmentation

!!! component-header "Info"

    **Current version:**
    
    **Project:** [Metadata augmentation](https://github.com/soilwise-he/metadata-augmentation)

## Functionality

In this component scripting / NLP / LLM are used on a metadata record to augment metadata statements about the resource. Augmentations are stored on a dedicated augmentation table, indicating the process which produced it.

### Spatial scope analyser

A script that analyses the spatial scope of a resource

The bounding box is matched to country bounding boxes

To understand if the dataset has a global, continental, national or regional scope

- Retrieves all datasets (as iso19139 xml) from database (records table joined with augmentations) which:
    - have a bounding box 
    - no spatial scope
    - in iso19139 format
- For each record it compares the boundingbox to country bounding boxes: 
    - if bigger then continents > global
    - If matches a continent > continental
    - if matches a country > national
    - if smaller > regional
- result is written to as an augmentation in a dedicated table

## Foreseen functionality

### Translation module

Many records arrive in a local language, we aim to capture at least english main properties for the record: title, abstract, keywords, lineage, usage constraints

- has a db backend, every translation is captured in a database
- the EU translation service is used, this service returns a asynchronous response to an API endpoint (callback)
- the callback populates the database, next time the translation is available
- make sure that frontend indicates if a string has been machine translated, with option to flag as inappropriate

API documentation: <https://language-tools.ec.europa.eu/>

### Keywords matcher

Analyses existing keywords on a metadata record, it matches an existing keyword to a list of predefined keywords, augmenting the keyword to include a thesaurus and uri reference (potentially a translation to English).

It requires a database (relational or RDF) with common thesauri.

### Metadata cleaning


### Spatial Locator

Analyses existing keywords to find a relevant geography for the record, it then uses the [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/about.html){target=_blank} API to find spatial coordinates for the geography, which are inserted into the metadata record.


### EUSO-high-value dataset tagging

The EUSO high-value datasets are those with substantial potential to assess soil health status, as detailed on the [EUSO dashboard](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/){target=_blank}. This framework includes the concept of [soil degradation indicator](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/soil-degradation-indicators-eu){target=_blank} metadata-based identification and tagging. Each dataset (possibly only those with the supra-national spatial scope) will be annotated with a potential soil degradation indicator for which it might be utilised. Users can then filter these datasets according to their specific needs. 

The EUSO soil degradation indicators employ specific [methodologies and thresholds](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/euso/euso-dashboard-sources){target=_blank} to determine soil health status, see also the Table below. These methodologies will also be considered, as they may have an impact on the defined thresholds. This issue will be examined in greater detail in the future.

Technically, we forsee the metadata tagging process as illustrated below. At first, metadata record's title, abstract and keywords will be checked for the occurence of specific **values from the Soil Indicator and Soil Degradation Codelists**, such as `Water erosion` or `Soil erosion` (see the Table above). If found, the `Soil Degradation Indicator Tag` (corresponding value from the Soil Degradation Codelist) will be displayed to indicate suitability of given dataset for soil indicator related analyses. Additionally, a search for corresponding **methodology** will be conducted to see if the dataset is compliant with the EUSO Soil Health indicators presented in the [EUSO Dashboard](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/){target=_blank}. If found, the tag `EUSO High-value dataset` will be added. In later phase we assume search for references to Scientific Methodology papers in metadata record's links. Next, the possibility of involving a more complex search using soil thesauri will also be explored.
