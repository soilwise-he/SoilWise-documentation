Persistent Identifier Mint
==========================

The [Uniform Resource Identifier](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396) (URI)
is one of the earliest and most consequent specifications of the Semantic Web.
Originally meant to identify web resources, it became a central piece of the Web
of data concept with the [Resource Description
Framework](https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-schema/) (RDF). In time researchers
understood not only its relevance providing unique and universal identifiers to
data, but also the importance of their longevity, past the life-time of
projects, organisations or institutions. Thus emerged the concept of Persistent
Unique Identifier (PI or PID, i.e. a URI valid "for ever") and its recognition
[as the foundation](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00025) of the Semantic Web
and the [FAIR
initiative](https://fairsfair.eu/d22-fair-semantics-first-recommendations-request-comments/p-rec-1-use-globally-unique-persistent-and).

Within the SoilWise project, the persistent identification of meta-data records
(and eventually the resources those meta-data describe) is therefore a
fundamental aspect. The process or technology responsible for issuing and
assigning PIDs in SoilWise has heretofore been known as "Persistent Identifier
Mint". In principle it will rely on a third party for the allocation and
resolution of PIDs, that then redirect to the SoilWise Repository. These PIDs
can be used internally to identify meta-data records, knowledge graphs in
quad-stores and even as alternative identifiers of external resources. The
paragraphs below enumerate various options in this regard.



ePIC
----

[Persistent Identifiers for eResearch](https://www.pidconsortium.net/) (ePIC)
was founded in 2009 by a consortium of European partners in order to provide PID
services for the European Research Community, based on the [Handle
system](https://www.handle.net/). Consortium members signed a Memorandum of
Understanding aiming to provide the necessary resources for the long term
reliability for its PID services (allocation, resolution, long-term validity).
ePIC has since expanded into an international consortium, open to partners from
the research community worldwide.



ARK Alliance
------------

The [ARK Alliance](https://arks.org/) is an global, open community supporting the
ARK infrastructure on behalf of research and scholarship. This institution
provides Archival Resource Keys (ARKs), that serve as persistent identifiers, or
stable, trusted references for digital information objects, physical or
abstract. ARKs are meant to provide researchers (and other users) with long term
access to the global scientific and cultural record. Since 2001 some 8.2
milliard ARKs have been created by over 1000 organisations — libraries, data
centres, archives, museums, publishers, government agencies and vendors. The ARK
Alliance strives for seamless access to its PID services, on an open,
non-paywalled and decentralised paradigm.
 
DataCite
--------

[DataCite](https://datacite.org/) was founded in 2009 on the principle of being
an open stakeholder-governed community that is open to participation from
organisations worldwide. This initiative was formed with the aim to safeguard
common standards worldwide to support research, thereby facilitating compliance
with the rules of good scientific practice.  DataCite maintains open
infrastructure services to ensure that research outputs and resources comply
with the FAIR principles. DataCite’s services are foundational components of the
scholarly ecosystem. Among theses services are the creation and management of
PIDs. 


The FREYA project
-----------------

The [FREYA](https://www.project-freya.eu/) project funded by the European
Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme, active between 2017 and 202.  It
aimed to build the infrastructure for persistent identifiers as a core component
of open science, in the EU and globally. FREYA worked to improve discovery,
navigation, retrieval, and access of research resources. New provenance services
enabled researchers to better evaluate data and make the scientific record more
complete, reliable, and traceable. The [FREYA Knowledge
Hub](https://www.project-freya.eu/en/resources/knowledge-hub) was designed to
help users understand what persistent identifiers are, why they exist, and how
to use them for research. It includes comprehensive guides and webinars to help
start working with PIDs.
