# User Interface: Dashboard

The term dashboard is used with various meanings, in the scope of Soilwise the following uses are relevant:

- A [search interface on metadata](#search-interface-on-metadata), search results are typically displayed in a paginated set of web pages. This aspect is managed by the [Catalogue component](./catalogue.md). But alternative mechanisms, such as an interactive map or [chatbot](./llm.md), are of interest.
- A set of [diagrams showing an overview of the contents and usage of the catalogue](./dashboards.md); for example a diagram of the percentage of records by topiccategory, number of visits by EU Member State.

Other parts of the dashboard are:

- [Metadata authoring](./metadata_authoring.md) and [harvest configuration](../technical_components/ingestion.md) components
- [Data download & export](#data-download-export) options

SoilWise Dashboard is intended to support the implementation of User stories, deliver useful and usable apps for various stakeholders, provide interface for user testing and present data and knowledge in a useable way.
