## Semantic Web specifications for meta-data

### Dublin Core

The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES), better known simply as [Dublin
Core](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5013.html), was the first meta-data
infrastructure produced within the Semantic Web. It owns its name to a city in
Ohio, wherein its foundations were laid in 1995.  Dublin Core was formalised as
[ISO-15836](https://www.iso.org/standard/71339.html) in 2003 and is maintained
by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), a branch of the Association for
Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T). A revision was published in 2017
(ISO-15836-1:2017).


The first complete release of Dublin Core dates back to 2000, comprising
fifteen meta-data terms meant to describe physical and digital resources,
independently of context. In its first iterations, these terms were loosely
defined, without specification on their application to resources. In 2012 a RDF
model was released, thereafter known as DCMI Metadata Terms. Still it kept its
flexibility, not imposing constraints on the resources with which the terms can
be used.


The DCMI Metadata Terms are organised within four modules, digested below:

- **[Elements](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/)**: the original set of
  elements published in 2000, specified as RDF properties. Among other
  concepts, includes `dc:contributor`, `dc:creator`, `dc:date`,
  `dc:identifier`, `dc:language`, `dc:publisher`, `dc:rights` and `dc:title`. 

- **[Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/)**: it includes the original fifteen
  elements, but adds classes and restrictions on their use. This module also
  specifies relations between its elements, meant for a more formal application
  of the standard. Of note are the classes `dcterms:BibliographicResource`,
  `dcterms:LicenseDocument`, `dcterms:Location` and `dcterms:PeriodOfTime`.
  Among the predicates it defines `dcterms:license` and `dcterms:provenance`
  can be highlighted.

- **[DCMI Type](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/)**: defines a further set of
  resource classes that may be described with Dublin Core meta-data terms. This
  set includes classes such as `Collection`, `Dataset`, `Image`,
  `PhysicalObject`, `Service`, `Software`, `Sound` and `Text`. 

- **[Abstract Model](http://purl.org/dc/dcam/)**: meant to document meta-data
  themsleves and general not expected to be applied by end users.
