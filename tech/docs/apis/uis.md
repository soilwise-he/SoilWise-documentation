# User Interfaces (UIs)

Within the first development iteration, the following User Interfaces are deployed as part the SoilWise repository:

- Interfaces for end users
    - **SWR Catalogue** <https://repository.soilwise-he.eu/>

- Interfaces for administration and system management

## Future work

SoilWise will in the future deploy adapted, and possibly newly developed user interfaces to serve it's users, such as:

- A chatbot interface, allowing users to perform natural language queries, using Large Language Models

- A dashboard showing the evolution of the SWR data and knowledge contents, quality indicators etc

- A new or adapted end user interface, that allows exploitation of a search engine, including faceted search, ranking of results etc.
