# User Interfaces (UIs)

The usabilty of the SoilWise repository will eventually not only be determined by it's back-end functionality and the (meta)data and knowledge it exposes. User, whether they are data & knowledge providers, users or SWR administrators, will operate the system through various user interfaces.  

Within the first development iteration, the following User Interfaces have been deployed as part the SoilWise repository:

- Interfaces for end users
    - **SWR Catalogue** <https://repository.soilwise-he.eu/>
    - **Hale Studio** as a standalone desktop application, which can be downloaded here: <https://wetransform.to/halestudio/> 

- Interfaces for administration and system management
    - **Summary SWR Catalogue Dashboard** <https://dashboards.isric.org/superset/dashboard/43/>

## Future work

SoilWise will in the future deploy adapted, and newly developed user interfaces to serve it's stakeholder groups, such as:

- A chatbot interface, allowing users to perform natural language queries, using Large Language Models.

- A monitoring dashboard showing the evolution of the SWR data and knowledge contents, quality indicators etc

- A new or adapted catalogue end user interface, that allows integration search engine queries and responses, including faceted search, ranking of results etc.
