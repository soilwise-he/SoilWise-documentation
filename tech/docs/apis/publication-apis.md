**Currently under discussion if a publication API will be supported because the primary mechanism to add (meta)data to SWR is via harvesting remote sources.**

An API can be developed to publish (or update existing) data and/or metadata. 

Requires a user to be logged in and have publication permission.

A review step may have to be required before allowing the suggested changes.

A suggestion for development could be to let the API prepare a Pull request to Git, for the record to be merged into the (meta)data collection.
