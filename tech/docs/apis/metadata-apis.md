## OAI-PMH + Datacite

With this endpoint we aim to enable the academia and open data community to interact with the SWR. Records from SWR can be harvested from CKAN and Dataverse software using this interface.

## Sitemap.xml + schema.org

The search engine community typically uses the Sitemap and schema.org annotations to crawl the SWR content

## Catalog service for the Web and OGC API records

The spatial community typically use CSW and OGC API Records to interact with catalogues. An example scenario is a catalogue search from within QGIS, using the Metasearch panel.
